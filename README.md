Hello gentlemen. So we are presenting the final project on May 1. It may be due April 20 along with Assignment 3. Anywho, we can literally do anything or expand upon one of our previous projects. We should probably decide what to do soon considering.

--------------IMPORTANT----------------------
* This program as it stands is already compiled for your convenience.
* All you must do is:
	1)Make sure that you have the java jdk installed for your operating system and it is set to jet in the right environment variable %path%
	2)navigate to runfolder, and type "java videoMain"
* That should do it!
* If you want to add your own image sequence, follow the instructions in videoMain.java and recompile
* Have a superbulous day

-------------farewell--------------------
Cheers
