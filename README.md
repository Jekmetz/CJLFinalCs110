Hello gentlemen. So we are presenting the final project on May 1. It may be due April 20 along with Assignment 3. Anywho, we can literally do anything or expand upon one of our previous projects. We should probably decide what to do soon considering.

--------------ideas----------------------
* mess with Curtis's emoji thing
* make something slightly more efficient
* hack the Gibson
* monitor some data that we find online (For instance a plane crash)
* make an app
* combine three mini lion programs into one super program
* make a neural network that determines if a picture is a boy or a girl
* neural network in general


-------------farewell--------------------
Cheers
