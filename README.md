--------------IMPORTANT----------------------
* This program as it stands is already compiled for your convenience.
* All you must do is:
	1)Make sure that you have the java jdk installed for your operating system and it is set to jet in the right environment variable %path%
	2)navigate to runfolder, and type "java videoMain"
* That should do it!
* If you want to add your own image sequence, follow the instructions in videoMain.java and recompile
* Have a superbulous day

-------------Eclipse Noobs---------------
* If you really must run this in eclipse, then I have the repository just for you!
* Go to Jekmetz on github and look for the repository CJLFinalProjCsEclipse.
* Import that in eclipse and it should do swimmingly

-------------farewell--------------------
