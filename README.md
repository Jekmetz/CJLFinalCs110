Hello gentlemen. So we are presenting the final project on May 1. It may be due April 20 along with Assignment 3. Anywho, we can literally do anything or expand upon one of our previous projects. We should probably decide what to do soon considering.

--------------ideas----------------------
* mess with Curtis's emoji thing
* make something slightly more efficient
* hack the Gibson
* monitor some data that we find online (For instance a plane crash)
* make an app
* combine three mini lion programs into one super program
* make a neural network that determines if a picture is a boy or a girl
* neural network in general

* Most Considered - Emoji Videl
	* Curtis has the software that converts picture to emoji
	* I have the software to display a bunch of buffered images
		* To save space and RAM, I can modify it to just display the color[][]s if that is what the Emoji converter spits out.


-------------farewell--------------------
Cheers
